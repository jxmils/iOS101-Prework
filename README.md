# App Brainstorming
A list of my favorite 3-5 applications and 2-3 features that make them my favorite app. 

## 1. Messages App (iOS)
* **Responsive**: Messages are sent and received very quickly
* **Reliable**: If messages are not sent now, you can opt in to send it when you get service
* **Emojis**: Emojis allow a way to express yourself

## 2. Spotify
* **Personalized Playlist**: Spotify makes curated playlist for your individual taste
* **Offline Listening**: You can download music and listen even if you are not conntected to the internet
* **Sharing**: You are able to share music with friends and family easily that includes album/song/playlist covers

## 3. Duolingo
* **Learning**: It feels like learning is a game (points, streaks, leaderboards)
* **Lessons**: Clean and uncluttered lessons with defined lesson modules that use icons to show the focus of the lesson
* **Progress Tracking**: A progress dashboard with visual indications of your progress

## 4. Pinterest
- **Visual**: The browsing is grid like and easy to scroll through
- **Custom Boards**: Drag and Drop functionality to create your own boards
- **Search**: The search bar is interactive and includes smart suggestions

# App Idea
An app idea that I would love to build.

## DueNext
I started developing this app but I would still like to expand on it
I want to gamify the planning and completion of assignments and allow users to track assignments and their grades on past assignments

### Features
* **Color Coded Assignments/Subjects**: I want subjects and assignments to be color coded so that organization is easy
* **Custom Subjects**: Having a default list of subjects can feel bounding. I want users to be able to create custom subjects and assign work to those subjects/
* **User Profiles**: Users should have their own profiles
* **Daily Streak**: Reward users for logging in and marking tasks as complete every day
* **Leveling System**: Users earn XP (experience points) for completing assignments on time, with bonus XP for completing them early
* **Achievement Badges**: Awards for milestones like completing 10 assignments in a week, finishing all tasks on time, or improving grades in a specific subject
