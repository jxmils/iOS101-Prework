# App Idea
An app idea that I would love to build.

## DueNext
DueNext is a student-focused productivity app designed to simplify assignment tracking and grading while making the planning and completion of tasks engaging and fun. The app combines gamification with organization tools, enabling users to create, track, and manage their assignments across different subjects, all while improving motivation through rewards and analytics.

### Features
* **Color Coded Assignments/Subjects**: I want subjects and assignments to be color coded so that organization is easy

* **User Profiles**: Users should have their own profiles
* **Daily Streak**: Reward users for logging in and marking tasks as complete every day
* **Leveling System**: Users earn XP (experience points) for completing assignments on time, with bonus XP for completing them early
